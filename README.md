poop sends an endless stream of HTTP chunk transfer encoded poop.

`poop [-addr addr]`

Example:

```sh
poop &
$BROWSER http://localhost:8080
```

In a terminal emulator with Unicode support, with a font that includes the poop
emoji glyph, invoke `curl(1)` with the `-N` option to disable buffering and
enjoy this app from the comfort of your terminal.
